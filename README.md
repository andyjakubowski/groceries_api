# Linda Groceries API

[![Open Demo](public/open-demo-button.svg)](https://andyjakubowski.github.io/groceries/)

An API-only Rails app acting as a server backing [`groceries`](https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries): a real time, offline-capable grocery list.

## How it Works

- Grocery list items are persisted in an `items` table inside a Postgres database.
- Rails Action Cable is used to broadcast `items` CRUD operations with a WebSocket.
- Action Cable is configured with Redis in production.

## Play with the [live demo](https://andyjakubowski.github.io/groceries/)

The client-side repo [`groceries`](https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries) has a bunch of ideas for what to do in the demo ðŸŒŸ.

## Installation and Usage

To make sure everything runs smoothly, install the following on your machine first:

- Node.js 14.x
- Ruby 2.7.6
- Yarn 1.22.19
- Postgres 14

Now, clone the repo, `cd` into your repoâ€™s directory, and run the following commands:

```shell
# Install Ruby gems specified in /Gemfile
bundle install
# Install Node packages specified in /package.json
yarn install
# Set up a local Postgres database
bin/rails db:setup
```

If everything went right, you should now be able to start a local dev server with `rails`:

```shell
bin/rails server
```

## Deploying to Heroku

Please note that Heroku no longer offers free plans. But you should be able to deploy this app with some cheap plan prorated to the second. It shouldnâ€™t cost more than a couple of bucks.

Click the _Deploy to Heroku_ button below to deploy without having to do any manual configuration:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries_api)

Deploying manually will take more work. Here are some pointers:

- Download the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line), and log in.
- Provision the _Heroku Postgres_ add-on; this will set a DATABASE_URL config variable in Heroku, and the Rails app will use it to connect to the database.
- Provision the _Heroku Data for Redis_ add-on; this will set a REDIS_URL config variable in Heroku used by the Rails app.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

- Add a `lists` table so that many separate lists can be used instead of everyone using the same grocery list.

## Enabling HTTPS in development

Note: enabling HTTPS requires changes to both [`groceries`](https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries) and [`groceries_api`](https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries_api). For simplicity, I kept the instructions in this section the same in each repo.

Both this Groceries client and the [`groceries_api`](https://github.com/andyjakubowski/groceries_api) use HTTPS when deployed to production. You might want to enable HTTPS in development to get as close as possible to simulating a production environment.

When youâ€™re done with this setup, youâ€™ll be able to connect to your local server from any device in your local network using a custom made-up domain. This domain will only work in your local network.

Weâ€™ll be using `https://groceries.andy` for this client and `https://api.groceries.andy` for the API server.

This is a pretty involved process, and the individual steps may vary depending on your system. Iâ€™ll paint a broad picture and provide guidelines using macOS and iOS devices as examples here.

### Create a Certificate Authority and make your devices trust it

Follow the steps in this article to set it up:
[Create Your Own SSL Certificate Authority for Local HTTPS Development](https://deliciousbrains.com/ssl-certificate-authority-for-local-https-development/)

### Create SSL certificates for a custom domain to be used with the API server and the client

Follow the article mentioned in the previous step.

Once youâ€™ve generated the certificates, copy them into your repo:

- For the client, place the certificates in `/ssl`
- For the API server, place the certificates in `/config/ssl`

The client and the API server are already configured to work with `groceries.andy` as the client URL and `api.groceries.andy` as the API server URL. If you want to use another custom domain, youâ€™ll have to edit both projects:

Client

- The `HOST` env var in the `start-https` script in `package.json.
- The `REACT_APP_API_HOST_DEVELOPMENT_HTTPS` env var in `.env.development`

API server

- Edit the `config.hosts << "api.groceries.andy"` line in `/config/environments/development.rb`.

### Make your dev machine a DNS server for the custom domain

A made-up domain like `groceries.andy` doesnâ€™t exist. We donâ€™t want to go out into the open internet and ask any DNS servers where to find the computer behind `groceries.andy`. Instead, weâ€™ll make our own machine the DNS server _for this domain only_.

To do that, we need to create a _resolver_ that will point from a domain name to a nameserver. Run the following command:

```shell
cd /etc
mkdir resolver
cd resolver
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee groceries.andy
```

You might not have write permissions to `/etc`. Cautiously run with `sudo` in that case.

Confirm that our resolver was created:

```shell
scutil --dns
```

### Resolve the custom domain to localhost

Weâ€™ll use `dnsmasq` as our DNS forwarder. Whenever someone asks for `groceries.andy`, weâ€™ll forward them to `localhost`.

Install `dnsmasq` with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install dnsmasq
```

Find the configuration file for `dnsmasq`. On Apple silicon Macs itâ€™s in `/opt/homebrew/etc/dnsmasq.conf`. Open the file and add the following line to it:

```shell
address=/groceries.andy/127.0.0.1
```

`dnsmasq` runs continously as a service on your machine. Restart it so that your changes take effect:

```shell
brew services restart dnsmasq
```

You might need to run the above command with `sudo`.

Run any of the following to test that the forwarding works:

```shell
ping -c 1 happy.tree
dscacheutil -q host -a name happy.tree
dig happy.tree @localhost
```

### Point other devices to your dev machine as their DNS server

On your iPhone, go to the settings of your local Wi-Fi. Change the DNS setup from _Automatic_ to _Manual_. Enter your dev machineâ€™s local network IP address as the address of the DNS server.

### Run the dev server with HTTPS enabled

Phew, this was a lot! You should now be able to run the client and the API server with HTTPS in development.

Run your API server:

```shell
zsh -c "GROCERIES_API_HTTPS=true && rails s -b 'ssl://api.groceries.andy:9000?key=config/ssl/api.groceries.andy.key&cert=config/ssl/api.groceries.andy.crt'"
```

Run your client server:

```shell
yarn start-https
```
